This repository is intended to manage [FLA](http://mith.umd.edu/research/project/fla/) metadata used for testing OpenRefine with [OpenAnnotation](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/) annotations. It is part of the [HTRC MITH](http://mith.umd.edu/mith-awarded-hathitrust-research-center-grant/) project.

The CSV files were generated with [hathitables](http://github.com/umd-mith/hathitables).
